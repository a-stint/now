## Now

Inspired by a quote,

> "Don't get it perfect, get it going"

`Now` is a productivity-focused desktop application designed to help users **get things done** fast by combatting procastination through creating a false sense of urgency, an incentive reward system, and a side quest that reinforces the habit of moving quickly (using Monkeytype). 

Currently in its bare bones buggy stage.
